0. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
    1. A device with Debian, or Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, or Fedora, ... installed and working.

    2. An Android device with OS version 5.0 or above.
        2.u. Termux app installed

    3. Such devices MUST be connected to the SAME ROUTER or LAN.


1. INSTALLING CLIENT ON LINUX
    1. Install "pulsedoclient.sh" on your Linux computer at:
        /home/YOUR_USERNAME/opt/Pulsedo/

    2. Make sure it has permission for running! If it doesn't have, open file properties and check that box at "Permissions" tab.

    3. Create a link for pulsedoclient.sh with a file explorer and rename the link for "pulsedo". If your file explorer is a shitty one, open a terminal, browse to the same path and type:
         $ ln -s `pwd`/pulsedoclient.sh pulsedo
     YES, THEY ARE TWO GRAVE ACCENTS. COPY THAT COMMAND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TYPE THEM!!!

    3. Now move this link for:
        /home/YOUR_USERNAME/bin/

    4. You are now able for calling "pulsedo" when you're going to connect to PulsedoServer. Test it typing "pulsedo --help" on any terminal, it should print this message:
        | USE: ./pulsedoclient.sh [<command> | <-r |--remove-def-ip> | <-h | --help>]
        |
        | OPTIONS DESCRIPTION
        |             <command> - a command or program name to be runned with Pulsedo. That is, with the environment variable PULSE_SERVER set.
        |   -r, --remove-def-ip - remove the IP address you had accepted to save as default, so the script will prompt you for IP again.
        |            -h, --help - show this help text.
        | Warning: any options without dashes, except <command>, are ALL deprecated!

2. INSTALLING SCRIPT FOR SERVER INTO TERMUX ONTO YOUR ANDROID DEVICE
    0. Install Termux application and:
        0.u. Install PulseAudio server with:
            $ pkg install pulseaudio

    1. Copy "pulsedoserver.sh" for your phone's internal storage root folder (/sdcard)

    2. Open Configs menu and select Apps and notifications, select "Apps infos", select Termux and give it the permission for accessing your internal STORAGE.

    3. In Termux, run these following commands:
        $ mv /sdcard/pulsedoserver.sh ./pulsedo.sh
        $ chmod +x ./pulsedo.sh


3. PREPARING YOUR ANDROID FOR RECEIVING AUDIO FROM LINUX
    1. Run:
        $ ./pulsedo.sh --start
    2. Insert your computer's IP address OR a mask IP for receiving audio of any Linux device. [WE'VE TESTED ONE DEVICE ONLY]
    3. It's recommended to reply Y if you have used a IP mask. Otherwise, reply anything else.


4. RUNNING A PROGRAM WITH Pulsedo
    1. Type "pulsedo <program name>" on your terminal (or just type pulsedo for help)
    2. Insert IP address of your Android device (you can get it selecting your WiFi network on WiFi configs, or going on Status at Configs/System)
    3. Reply Y. If future connections fail, you can delete the default config and trying your phone's newer IP address.


5. DISCONNECTING PulsedoClient AND SHUTTING PulsedoServer DOWN
    1. Exit program started with Pulsedo.
    2. Close Terminal to make sure connection have been closed.
    3. Insert the following command on Termux:
        $ ./pulsedo.sh --kill-server
